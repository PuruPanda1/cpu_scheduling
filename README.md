# cpu_scheduling

We have been learning about CPU scheduling systems and various alogorithms but I have seen in many colleges, professors/teachers forgets to teach us 
the practical implementation of CPU scheduling but practical implementation is important and thus i have created this repository to showcase basic
implementation of various CPU scheduling using JAVA language. 

CPU Scheduling Algorithms:
1.FCFS - First Come First Served
2.SJF - Shortest Job Firt
3.Priority - Premetive Priority Scheduling
4.RR - Round Robin
